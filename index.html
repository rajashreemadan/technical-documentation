            <p>Learning some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is useful if you want to become a web developer,
              but your knowledge needs to go further than just using the technologies — you need to use them
              responsibly so that you maximize the audience for your websites and don't lock anyone out of using them.
              To achieve this, you need to adhere to general best practices, do cross browser testing, and consider
              accessibility from the start.</p>

            <p>A great deal of web content can be made accessible just by making sure the correct HTML elements are used
              for the correct purpose at all times.</p>
            <p>Semantic HTML doesn't take longer to write than non-semantic (bad) markup if you do it consistently from
              the start of your project, and it also has other benefits beyond accessibility:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Easier to develop with — as mentioned above, you get some functionality for free, plus it is arguably
                easier to understand.</li>
              <li>Better on mobile — semantic HTML is arguably lighter in file size than non-semantic spaghetti code, and
                easier to make responsive.</li>
              <li>Good for SEO — search engines give more importance to keywords inside headings, links, etc., than keywords
                included in non-semantic <code class="snippet">&lt;div&gt;</code>s, etc., so your documents will be more findable by customers.</li>

          <article class="description">
            <p>The language you use can also affect accessibility. In general you should use clear language that is not
              overly complex, and doesn't use unnecessary jargon or slang terms. This not only benefits people with cognitive
              or other disabilities; it benefits readers for whom the text is not written in their first language, younger
              people ... everyone in fact! Apart from this, you should try to avoid using language and characters that don't
              get read out clearly by the screenreader. For example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Don't use dashes if you can avoid it. Instead of writing 5–7, write 5 to 7.</li>
              <li>Expand abbreviations — instead of writing Jan, write January.</li>
              <li>Expand acronyms, at least once or twice. Instead of writing HTML in the first instance, write Hypertext Markup Language.</li>

          <article class="description">
            <p>UI control text labels are very useful to all users, but getting them right is particularly important to users
              with disabilities.</p>
            <p>You should make sure that your button and link text labels are understandable and distinctive. Don't just use
              "Click here" for your labels, as screenreader users sometimes get up a list of buttons and form controls. The
              following screenshot shows our controls being listed by VoiceOver on Mac.</p>
            <p>Make sure your labels make sense out of context, read on their own, as well as in the context of the paragraph
              they are in. For example, the following shows an example of good link text:</p>
            <div class="code-block">
            <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;</code><code>
  Whales are really awesome creatures.</code><code>
  &lt;a href="whales.html"&gt;Find out more about whales.&lt;/a&gt;</code><code>
&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>but this is bad link text:</p>
            <div class="code-block">
              <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;</code><code>
  Whales are really awesome creatures. To find more out about whales,</code><code>
  &lt;a href="whales.html"&gt;click here.&lt;/a&gt;</code><code>
&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>You can also see some good and bad examples at good-links.html and bad-links.html.</p>

        <section id="Form_labels" class="main-section">
          <header class="section-header">Form labels</header>
          <article class="description">
            <p>Form labels are also important, for giving you a clue what you need to enter into each form input. The following
              seems like a reasonable enough example:</p>
            <div class="code-block">
              <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Fill in your name:&lt;/p&gt;</code><code>
&lt;input type="text" id="name" name="name"&gt;</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>However, this is not so useful for disabled users. There is nothing in the above example to associate the label
              unambiguously with the form input, and make it clear how to fill it in if you cannot see it. If you access this
              with some screenreaders, you may only be given a description along the lines of "edit text".</p>
            <p>The following is a much better example:</p>
            <div class="code-block">
              <pre><code class="code">&lt;div&gt;</code><code>
  &lt;label for="name"&gt;Fill in your name:&lt;/label&gt;</code><code>
  &lt;input type="text" id="name" name="name"&gt;</code>code>
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>With the code like this, the label will be clearly associated with the input; the description will be more like
              "Fill in your name: edit text".</p>
            <p>As an added bonus, in most browsers associating a label with a form input means that you can click the label to
              select/activate the form element. This gives the input a bigger hit area, making it easier to select.</p>

            <p>Whereas textual content is inherently accessible, the same cannot necessarily be said for multimedia content —
              image/video content cannot be seen by visually-impaired people, and audio content cannot be heard by hearing-impaired people.</p>
            <p>We have a simple example written up, accessible-image.html, which features three copies of the same image:</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <code class="code">&lt;img src="dinosaur.png"&gt;</code>
            </div>
            <p>The first image, when viewed by a screen reader, doesn't really offer the user much help — VoiceOver for example
              reads out "/dinosaur.png, image". It reads out the filename to try to provide some help, but often files may be
              uploaded with machine generated file names and these file names would likely provide no context to the image's
              content.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
              <pre><code class="code">&lt;img src="dinosaur.png"
     alt="A red Tyrannosaurus Rex: A two legged dinosaur standing upright like a human,
     with small arms, and a large head with lots of sharp teeth."&gt;</code></pre>
            </div><p>When a screen reader encounters the second image, it reads out the full alt attribute — "A red
              Tyrannosaurus Rex: A two legged dinosaur standing upright like a human, with small arms, and a large head with
              lots of sharp teeth.".</p>
            <p>This highlights the importance of not only using meaningful file names in case so-called alt text is not
              available, but also making sure that alt text is provided in alt attributes wherever possible. Note that the
              contents of the alt attribute should always provide a direct representation of the image and what it conveys
              visually. Any personal knowledge or extra description shouldn't be included here, as it is not useful for people
              who have not come across the image before.</p>
            <p>One thing to consider is whether your images have meaning inside your content, or whether they are purely for
              visual decoration, so have no meaning. If they are decorational, it is better to just include them in the page
              as CSS background images.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
              <pre><code class="code">&lt;img src="dinosaur.png"
     alt="A red Tyrannosaurus Rex: A two legged dinosaur standing upright like a human,
     with small arms, and a large head with lots of sharp teeth."
     title="The Mozilla red dinosaur"&gt;</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>If you do want to provide extra contextual information, you should put it in the text surrounding the image, or
              inside a title attribute, as shown above. In this case, most screenreaders will read out the alt text, the title
              attribute, and the filename. In addition, browsers display title text as tooltips when moused over.</p>

          <article class="description">
            <p>When choosing a color scheme for your website, make sure that the text (foreground) color contrasts well with the
              background color. Your design might look cool, but it is no good if people with visual impairments like color
              blindness can't read your content.</p>
            <p>There is an easy way to check whether your contrast is large enough to not cause problems. There are a number
              of contrast checking tools online that you can enter your foreground and background colors into, to check them.
              For example WebAIM's Color Contrast Checker is simple to use, and provides an explanation of what you need to
              conform to the WCAG criteria around color contrast.</p>
